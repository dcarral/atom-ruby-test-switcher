# ruby-test-utilities package

Switch between Ruby code and test files by pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>.</kbd>

Inspired by the fantastic [Sublime Text 2 Ruby Tests](https://github.com/maltize/sublime-text-2-ruby-tests) plugin.

## FAQ

### How do I run my tests?

Take a look at [ruby-test](https://atom.io/packages/ruby-test)

## Can't I switch between code and test files with other packages?

Not at the moment.

- [ruby-test](https://atom.io/packages/ruby-test) doesn't offer this functionality.
- [Rails Open Rspec](https://atom.io/packages/rails-open-rspec) is Rails-dependent (as its name suggests)

The idea is to integrate this switching functionality within the ruby-test package at some point in the future. So, if you use ruby-test, you won't need an extra-package to switch between code and test files.

## How can I contribute?

Pull requests are welcome (bonus point for topic branches)

## Why it's not working as expected?
